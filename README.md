# The-Final-Engagement
The Final Project was completed as a student in the Arizona State University Cybersecurity Bootcamp. The virtual network this project was completed on consisted of a Windows gateway, and five Linux machines (Kali, Capstone, ELK, Target1, Target2). 

The Kali-Linux machine was the penetration testing machine. ELK was the SIEM. Capstone was a vulnerable machine. Targets 1 and 2 were vulnverable WordPress Servers.  The VN was enclosed in a Microsoft Azure system.

The project entailed attacking, defending, and analyzing this vulnerable network.
